Questions:

- What are all the car parameters? (acceleration curve, grip, etc)
    - Where are the addresses for those?
- How does a speech baloon pop up?
    - At what address in code does this check happen?
        - PRGROM: $05D9C is a good place to start
        - PRGROM: $05A75 is a good place to start
- How does opponent car color gets decided each race?
    - PRGROM: $79281
- How does collision work?
    - Where is it at the code?
    - Create an emulator lua script that will show all of the hitboxes in real time
- How does acceleration (speed calculation) work?
    - Where is it at the code?
    - How does inclination of the road gets into this?
        - Where is this information stored?
- How does latteral movement (grip) gets calculated?
    - Where is it in the code?
- How does bot AI work?
    - Where is it at the code?
- How does rubberbanding works?
    - Where is it at the code?
- When is the RACE OVER?
    - One of the conditions is when all of the 10 winning point positions are filled
- Is it possible to have a consistent landscape rotation
    - No. Landscape rotation is just an illusion, it does not reflect the way the car is heading.
    You can check this by standing at the start with P1 and doing an entire lap with P2 (For instance, in New York).
    Then, the rotation of the landscape will be different between them. This comes from the fact that the
    rotation itself is not consistent and the track does not even exist in a cartesian/euclidean space.
- Tip the landscape tiles
- Create a game with 1 lap of each track

Cheats:
Got from mesen cheat database. Looking in the internet, found them here:

- Always finish first
    A1F2:18
    Changes AND #$1F to AND #$18
    It manages this by putting P1 into the finish every time a player from 0 to 7 id, finished the race
    When a player from 8 to 19 finishes, then it puts id number 8
    This one has a lot of side effects, like getting multiple positions in the rank
    If those side effects are not a problem, then A1F2:0 would be a better solution, writing P1 to all
    finishing positions. 
- Don't slow down against cars
    5E4BC:00 - Changes BCS (+3) to BCS (+0) effectively turning that opcode into NOP in $05E4BB (PRGROM: $02E4BB)
    5E4B7:00 - Changes BCS (+8) to BCS (+0) effectively turning that opcode into NOP in $05E4B6 (PRGROM: $02E4B6)
- Don't slow down against obstacles
    5D6E9:00

TODO:
- Apply collision to obstacles into script - check cheat code
- Apply collision to cars into script - check soneka script


IRQ happens at:
    optional:(middle of last p1 landscape scanline) scanline: (varies between 0 and the next) cycle: around 88
    (middle of last p1 scanline) scanline: 108 Cycle: 123-154
    optional:(middle of last p2 landscape scanline) scanline: (varies between the other 2)
    (end) scanline 224 Cycle 123-154

This is why there is some strange pixels in the last scanline of the landscape:
Sometimes things are written to the registers before the last scanline ends. This is probably made
in order to use the most of the black scanlines in the middle
